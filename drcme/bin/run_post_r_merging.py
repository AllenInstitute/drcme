"""
Script for determining how many GMM components to merge.

Gaussian mixture model (GMM) components are merged into a smaller number of clusters
using an entropy criterion as described by `Baudry et al. (2010) <https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1198/jcgs.2010.08111>`_.
A piecewise linear fit is used to determine the point at which merging should terminate.
