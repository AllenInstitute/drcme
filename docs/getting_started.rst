===============

The `drcme` package has several functions and scripts for the analysis and clustering of
electrophysiological and morphological data. For certain electrophysiological analyses,
it is designed to work with data processed by the
`IPFX package <https://github.com/alleninstitute/ipfx>`_.

There are several _`scripts <source/reference/scripts>` provided for common tasks that expect
JSON files as inputs. These could be used as-is or customized for your own analysis needs.
